<h1>How Average Are You? 10 Surprising Statistics About Being "Normal"</h1>

<p>Most of us think we're pretty normal. Average height, average habits, average life. But "average" is a slippery concept — and when you actually compare yourself to global data, the results are often shocking.</p>

<p>We built <a href="/how-average-are-you/">How Average Are You?</a> to let you find out exactly where you fall on dozens of real statistical distributions. Here's what the data reveals about what "average" actually means.</p>

<h2>What Does "Average" Actually Mean?</h2>

<p>Statistically, the average is just the mean of a dataset — but almost nobody sits exactly at the mean on everything. In fact, a person who is perfectly average on just seven different traits would be extraordinarily rare. Researcher Todd Rose at Harvard found that when the U.S. Air Force designed cockpits for the "average pilot" using 10 body measurements, literally zero out of 4,063 pilots were average on all 10. Not one.</p>

<p>This is the paradox of averages: the average person doesn't exist. You're always unusual in some dimension.</p>

<h2>10 Global Averages That Might Surprise You</h2>

<p>The average adult human height worldwide is about 171 cm (5'7") for men and 159 cm (5'3") for women, but this varies enormously by country. The tallest average populations are in the Netherlands and the Balkans, while the shortest tend to be in Southeast Asia and Central America.</p>

<p>The global average for sleep is approximately 7 hours and 9 minutes per night, according to research published in Science Advances. But people in Singapore and Japan average under 6.5 hours, while people in the Netherlands get nearly 8.5 hours. Your sleep habits say more about your culture than your biology.</p>

<p>People check their phones an average of 96 times per day — roughly once every 10 minutes during waking hours. Younger adults (18-24) check even more frequently, averaging over 120 checks per day. The average daily screen time globally has surpassed 6 hours and 40 minutes.</p>

<p>The average resting heart rate is between 60-100 beats per minute, but well-trained athletes can have resting rates as low as 40 bpm. The global average sits around 72 bpm. If you're consistently above 80 at rest, it might be worth a conversation with your doctor.</p>

<p>The average person walks about 6,500 steps per day globally, though this varies dramatically — people in Hong Kong average over 9,500 steps, while Americans average closer to 4,800. The commonly cited "10,000 steps" goal was actually invented as a Japanese marketing campaign in the 1960s.</p>

<p>Most people have about 5 close friends and around 150 total social connections — a number known as Dunbar's Number, proposed by anthropologist Robin Dunbar. This limit appears to be hardwired into our brain's neocortex capacity.</p>

<p>The average person reads about 12 books per year in countries with high literacy rates, though the median is often lower — many people read zero books while heavy readers pull the average up. About 27% of American adults report not reading a single book in the past year.</p>

<p>The typical adult makes roughly 35,000 decisions per day, according to researchers at Cornell. About 226 of those are just about food. Most are so automatic you don't even notice them — which is exactly why we built our <a href="/how-many-decisions-you-make-today/">decisions experience</a> too.</p>

<p>The global average commute time is about 40 minutes each way. But in megacities like Tokyo, Mumbai, and São Paulo, commutes regularly exceed 90 minutes. Remote work has begun shifting these numbers in some regions.</p>

<p>The average person will spend roughly 26 years of their life sleeping, 4.5 years eating, and about 1.3 years in the bathroom. We spend more time sleeping than any other single activity across an entire lifetime.</p>

<h2>Why Comparing Yourself to Averages Is Tricky</h2>

<p>Averages can be misleading because they compress enormous variation into a single number. Income is the classic example — the "average" American household income is around $105,000, but the median is closer to $75,000 because a small number of extremely high earners pull the average up. Which number better represents "typical"? That depends on what you're trying to understand.</p>

<p>The same principle applies to almost every human trait. Averages are useful landmarks, not definitions of normal. Being far from average on any single measure is completely ordinary.</p>

<h2>Find Out Where You Stand</h2>

<p>Curious how you actually compare? Our <a href="/how-average-are-you/">How Average Are You?</a> quiz walks you through real statistical benchmarks and shows you exactly where you fall on each one. Most people are surprised by the results — especially on the questions they assumed they were normal on.</p>
