<h1>True or False Quiz: Can You Spot the Fake Facts? Test Your Knowledge</h1>

<p>A duck's quack doesn't echo. Humans use only 10% of their brains. Lightning never strikes the same place twice. You probably "know" at least one of these facts — and every single one is false. Our <a href="/true-or-false/">True or False</a> quiz tests whether you can separate real facts from convincing fiction.</p>

<h2>Why False Facts Stick</h2>

<p>There's a psychological phenomenon called the "illusory truth effect" — the more often you hear a statement, the more likely you are to believe it's true, regardless of whether it actually is. Researchers at Vanderbilt University found that even a single prior exposure to a false claim increased belief in it by a measurable amount. Repetition literally rewrites your sense of truth.</p>

<p>This effect is amplified by what psychologists call "cognitive fluency." Statements that are easy to process — simple, well-phrased, and confidently stated — feel more true than complex, nuanced ones. "We only use 10% of our brains" is snappy and memorable. "The brain's activity varies by region and task, with different areas active at different times, and virtually all areas show activity over a 24-hour period" is accurate but forgettable.</p>

<h2>Common Myths That Won't Die</h2>

<p>The Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. This myth has been repeated for centuries — predating space travel entirely — but astronauts have confirmed that the wall is too narrow (about 6 meters wide) to distinguish from orbit. Highways are actually more visible than the Great Wall from space.</p>

<p>Goldfish do not have 3-second memories. Research has shown that goldfish can remember things for months and can be trained to navigate mazes, pull levers for food, and recognize their owners. Their memory is comparable to many other fish species, which isn't saying they're geniuses, but they're far from the memoryless creatures of popular belief.</p>

<p>Humans do not have just five senses. Beyond sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, we also have proprioception (awareness of body position), nociception (pain), thermoception (temperature), vestibular sense (balance), and several others. The actual count depends on how you define "sense," but most neuroscientists put the number between 9 and 20.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters Beyond Trivia</h2>

<p>The ability to evaluate claims critically is arguably the most important skill in the information age. Misinformation spreads faster than corrections — a study published in Science found that false news stories on social media spread six times faster than true ones. The same cognitive biases that make quiz games tricky also make us vulnerable to manipulation at scale.</p>

<p>Practicing fact evaluation — even in a game context — builds the mental habit of pausing before accepting a claim. Does it sound too perfect? Too surprising? Too convenient? These intuitions, when calibrated by practice, become genuine protection against misinformation.</p>

<h2>Test Your Detection Skills</h2>

<p>Our <a href="/true-or-false/">True or False</a> quiz presents you with a mix of real facts and convincing false ones. The false claims are designed to sound plausible — they exploit the same cognitive biases that make real-world misinformation effective. Most people score between 60-70% on their first attempt, thinking they'd do much better. Can you beat that?</p>
