<h1>If You Were Born in a Different Country or Era: How Would Your Life Change?</h1>

<p>Where and when you're born is the single biggest factor determining how your life unfolds — more than talent, effort, or character. Our <a href="/if-you-were-born-in/">If You Were Born In…</a> experience lets you explore how dramatically life changes depending on that one roll of the cosmic dice.</p>

<h2>The Birth Lottery</h2>

<p>Philosopher John Rawls proposed a thought experiment: imagine you're designing society from behind a "veil of ignorance" — you don't know what position you'll hold in it. Where would you choose to be born? The exercise reveals how much of life is determined by circumstances entirely beyond our control.</p>

<p>A child born in Norway today can expect to live to about 83 years, receive free education through university, and earn an average income placing them in the global top 1%. A child born in the Central African Republic can expect to live to about 53 years, has a 37% chance of attending secondary school, and will earn roughly $500 per year. Same species, same planet, same moment in time — radically different lives.</p>

<h2>How Geography Shapes Everything</h2>

<p>Life expectancy varies by over 30 years between countries. Japan leads at about 84 years; several Sub-Saharan African nations average under 55. But it's not just lifespan — it's what fills those years. Access to clean water, healthcare, education, personal freedom, economic opportunity, and physical safety vary enormously.</p>

<p>Income inequality between countries is staggering. The average American earns more in two weeks than the average person in the Democratic Republic of Congo earns in an entire year. Yet within the historical context, even that Congolese worker earns more than a medieval European peasant, who earned more than a Roman slave. Progress is real but unevenly distributed.</p>

<p>Gender dramatically affects life outcomes depending on location. In Iceland, the gender gap in education, health, political representation, and economic opportunity is nearly closed. In Afghanistan, girls face severe restrictions on education and movement. Being born female is a neutral fact biologically but an enormous variable socially, depending entirely on geography.</p>

<h2>How Time Period Changes Everything</h2>

<p>If you were born in 1800, your expected lifespan was about 30-35 years regardless of where you lived. Child mortality was devastating — roughly 43% of children died before age 5 globally. Today that figure is under 4%. The improvement in child survival over the last two centuries is arguably the greatest achievement in human history.</p>

<p>Daily life in past eras was radically different from what we imagine. A medieval peasant worked hard during planting and harvest seasons but actually had more leisure time than a modern office worker for much of the year — an estimated 150+ holidays annually. However, "leisure" without electricity, plumbing, medicine, or literacy is a different proposition than a modern weekend.</p>

<p>The concept of childhood itself is relatively modern. Before the 18th century, children were largely treated as small adults — working alongside their parents from age 5-7, with no expectation of education or play as we understand them. The idea that children deserve a protected period of development is a remarkably recent innovation.</p>

<h2>Explore It Yourself</h2>

<p>Our <a href="/if-you-were-born-in/">If You Were Born In…</a> experience lets you select different countries and time periods, then shows you the concrete details of what your life would look like — income, education, health, daily routine, and freedoms. It's designed to make the abstract concept of global inequality viscerally real.</p>
