<h1>How Many Decisions Do You Make Per Day? The Science of Decision Fatigue</h1>

<p>How many decisions did you make today? If you guessed a few dozen, you're off by several orders of magnitude. Researchers at Cornell University estimated that the average adult makes approximately 35,000 conscious decisions per day — with about 226 of those just about food. Our <a href="/how-many-decisions-you-make-today/">decision explorer</a> breaks this down and reveals just how much mental energy your day really demands.</p>

<h2>Where Do 35,000 Decisions Come From?</h2>

<p>Most decisions happen below conscious awareness. Your brain constantly makes micro-decisions about posture, eye movement, walking speed, social cues, and environmental responses without ever consulting "you." Even decisions you think of as deliberate — like what to say in a conversation — are largely assembled unconsciously before your conscious mind gets involved.</p>

<p>The decisions you notice tend to be novel or consequential: what to eat for lunch, how to respond to an email, whether to take the highway or side streets. These conscious decisions are estimated at about 70-80 per hour during waking time. But your brain is processing far more in the background, filtering sensory input, adjusting your behavior, and making predictions about what happens next.</p>

<h2>Decision Fatigue Is Real</h2>

<p>Every decision depletes a shared pool of mental energy. Psychologist Roy Baumeister coined the term "decision fatigue" to describe the deteriorating quality of decisions made after long sessions of decision-making. A famous study of Israeli parole judges found that prisoners appearing before the board in the morning received parole about 70% of the time, while those appearing in late afternoon received it less than 10% of the time — regardless of the case merits.</p>

<p>Decision fatigue explains why you can be disciplined about your diet all day but cave to junk food at night. It's why Steve Jobs wore the same outfit every day and why Barack Obama limited his suits to blue and gray — they were deliberately eliminating trivial decisions to preserve mental energy for consequential ones.</p>

<h2>The Paradox of Choice</h2>

<p>Psychologist Barry Schwartz documented a counterintuitive finding: more options often lead to worse decisions and less satisfaction. In a famous jam study, shoppers presented with 24 varieties of jam were 10 times less likely to make a purchase than those presented with 6 varieties. The overwhelming number of options created decision paralysis.</p>

<p>Modern life has exponentially increased the number of choices we face. A typical grocery store contains about 30,000 items. Netflix offers thousands of titles. Social media presents an infinite scroll of content requiring constant micro-decisions about attention. Our decision-making hardware hasn't evolved since the Stone Age, but the number of decisions it faces has exploded.</p>

<h2>How to Make Better Decisions</h2>

<p>Reduce trivial decisions through routines and defaults. Automate or batch low-stakes choices. Make important decisions in the morning when your mental energy is highest. Limit your options deliberately — having fewer choices leads to faster, more satisfying decisions.</p>

<p>The 2-minute rule is effective: if a decision will take less than 2 minutes to implement, make it immediately rather than adding it to your mental queue. Every pending decision occupies working memory, reducing capacity for everything else.</p>

<h2>See Your Decision Load</h2>

<p>Our <a href="/how-many-decisions-you-make-today/">decision explorer</a> walks you through a typical day, category by category, revealing the hidden decision load in everything from getting dressed to commuting to work. Most people are genuinely surprised by the total. It reframes what "a tiring day" actually means — it's not just physical or emotional fatigue, it's decision fatigue.</p>
